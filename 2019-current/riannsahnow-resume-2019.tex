\textbf{About Me:} I'm Riann (pronounced Ryan).

\vspace{1pc}\qquad\qquad I am an experienced early childhood teacher of 15 years, transitioning to a primary school teacher role. I have completed my Colorado elementary teaching license
with the Friends Teacher Preparation Program and am currently finishing an M.A. in learning, development, and family sciences with a concentration in human learning and development through CU Denver.

\vspace{1pc}\qquad\qquad As a passionate teacher, I believe all students can learn at high levels and that this can be achieved by building and maintaining positive, inclusive, and
equitable relationships in and around the classroom. My goal is to nurture an engaging and collaborative learning environment that contributes positively to each child's success and
social emotional growth.
